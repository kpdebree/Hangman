# Hangman

Basically, I tried both assignments. I completed PSYCHIC, but I am stuck on Hangman. So far, I put in only filler CSS.

To make the Hangman game, I looked up on GitHub how other Hangman games worked, and I reverse engineered them (hope that's okay!), and I took everything apart and I organized it in my own way. To meet the specs, a lot of things needed to be changed, and I had to lookup how to do a lot of things on StackOverflow. Right now, its mostly functional, but I keep getting these [Object HTMLLIElement] tags everywhere, and I'm not sure what's causing it.

I'll try to update it as I go along over the weekend, which is past the date, but I just want to learn how to figure this thing out.
